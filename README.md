# Project
I am a Master's student at Illinois institute of technology. I have this project JAVA for the subject 'Introduction to Algorithm'.

About the project: 
The project is Coupan Inventory System. The functions that needs to be provided are adding a coupan, listing the available coupans and
providing the ui to sell a coupan. The project can also be completed on console. But as an experienced software developer, doing a project
on console wont be fun. Additional methods will make me eligible for extra credits.

WHAT I PLAN TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Though the project itself is not very fascinationg, i will try to develop with the best practices in the programming language and i will try to use best technologies that i can think of and that are open source and freely available.
2. I will implement all the datastructures required in this program. These will be kept at anothor repository(JAVA-Datastructures). Over the time and even after the completion of the project I will try to make better datastructres.
3. I plan to implement the UI of the project in JAVAFx, which is the leading technology in JAVA(atleaset at the time of writing this read me.).
4. But in future I plan to to make a web based application. As this project is not very challenging i may start another project for web based.
5. The data will be persisted on MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB. The mongoDb Atlas is the cloud cluster where i intend to store the data. At the time of writing this read me file I am a noobie in No SQL database and MongoDB, hence I am not very sure whether imlementing the MongoDb Atlas is the right thing to do or not. But i want to learn new things in this project I will do it anyway. I will learn the DB as the project progresses.

License:
Seriously buddy?
